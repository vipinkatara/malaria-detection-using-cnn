## General info
In this project, we have developed the neural network to classify, whether a cell is infected or not using Convolution Neural Network. We have used a dataset provided by Kaggle, which contains 27,558 images of infected and uninfected cells.


## Prerequisites
To use it, you require the following:

```
1. Python3
2. Pip
```

## Installing
Once you got the requisites on your machine, execute the following command:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all the required libraries for you.
	
## Dependencies
Project is created with:
* Keras: ```pip install keras```
* Numpy: ```pip install numpy```
* Matplotlib: ```pip install matplotlib```
* Seaborn: ```pip install seaborn```
* Scikit Learn: ```pip install sklearn```
* OpenCV: ```pip install opencv-python```

	
## Setup
To train the model, you can directly open the ```malaria_detection.ipynb``` in jupyter notebook or google colab.
else run the ```malaria_detection.py``` file.

```$ python3 malaria_detection.py```

To run the project, open a new terminal and execute the following:

```$ python3 app.py```
